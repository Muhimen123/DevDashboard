# DevDashboard
As the name suggests, dev dashboard is a CLI verstion of the [dev.to](https://www.dev.to) dashboard. It aims to help the writers to have a close look at few public data such as total post views, comments, reactions and many more. Why would anyone use a CLI instead of a awesome UI? Well, that depends. Primarily, it has some feature for data visualization. So, for those who loves data like me, it might be a useful thing.

# Installation
If you are using mac or linux then you are 50% done. However, if you are using windows or if you don't have python installed in your machine I will highly incourage you to install and setup python properly in your machine from the official [python website](https://www.python.org/).
